# Sandwich Fire

**Sandwich Fire** is a basic practice project created to teach **Savvy Coders** students how to use **Firebase**. It is written in _HTML5, CSS3,_ and _JavaScript ES6_. It is open for anyone to use for the purpose of learning **Firebase**. So fork it, clone it, recreate it, and completely revamp it at your leisure ;

**Step 1.** Fork it, clone it, cd into it and open it in your favorite editor.

**Step 2.** Make sure you're logged in to a Gmail account and navigate to https://firebase.google.com.

**Step 3.** Click the **Get Started** button and then click the **Create a project** button. Name your project "Sandwich Fire", accept the Firebase terms and hit **Continue**.
You can choose to have Google Analytics enabled or not, up to you, then hit **Continue**. Make sure the correct region is selected for where yu live, accept all agreements, and click **Create Project**.When your project is done being created, click **Continue**.

**Step 4.** We will be creating a web app so click the third circle with the open/closing angle brackets, under the "Get started by adding Firebase to your app" heading. Give your app a nickname you will remember, if you try to use just **sandwich fire** you will get a message that it isn't available, so, if you want to use "Sandwich Fire" in the name, you will have to follow it with something else, such as a group of numbers. Once you decide on a name click **Register App**.

**Step 5.** Copy the code snippet containing your script tags and configuration to your clipboard and paste it in the bottom of your body tag of the index.html file. We will be moving the configuration information to a separate file that isn't created yet so **DO NOT COMMIT ANYTHING YET**.
